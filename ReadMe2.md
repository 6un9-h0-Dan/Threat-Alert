As the world shifts from private to public cloud infrastructure, the need for agile security solutions has given rise to the world of DevSecOps.  This means thinking about application and infrastructure security from the start. It also means automating your approach to security to not block other areas of your DevOps workflow such as CI/CD. While any true DevSecOps environment starts with a cultural shift, the importance of selecting the right tools to seamlessly integrate with your environment cannot be understated. StackArmor leverages a robust portfolio of software (some homegrown, some enterprise license, some FOSS) to meet the security needs of customers across every industry: FedRAMP, PCI, and HIPAA to name a few.
